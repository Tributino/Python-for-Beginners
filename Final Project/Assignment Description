Learning Outcomes:
After successfully completing this activity, students will have the ability to:
Analyze and explore a database stored in CSV/JSON format.
Employ python libraries to carry out data analysis tasks, including collecting, cleaning,
and data visualization.
Assignment Description:
Through the use of the Kaggle platform, students will choose a dataset and then
present their data analysis results in a Jupyter notebook file. It's okay to use generative
AI and code from other Kaggle users, as long as the student understands the code fully
and gives proper credit to the source.
Elements that will be evaluated:
1. Database,
2. Student comments in Jupyter Notebook cells to explain the commands,
3. The number of Libraries used,
4. The graphs used to represent the data,
5. Student presentation,
6. Feature Engineering,
7. Machine learning algorithm,
8. Bibliography
