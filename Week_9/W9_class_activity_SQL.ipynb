    "## 1. What is a database\n",
    "\n",
    "A `database` is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use `structured query language (SQL)` for writing and querying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SQL` is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different database systems which are used for a wide variety of purposes including: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. We focus on `SQLite` in this course because it is a very common database and is already built into Python. `SQLite` is designed to be embedded into other applications to provide database support within the application.\n",
