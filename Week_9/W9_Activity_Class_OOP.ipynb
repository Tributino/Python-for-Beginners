    "At the beginning of this course, we came up with four basic programming patterns which we use to construct programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequential code\n",
    "- Conditional code (if statements) \n",
    "- Repetitive code (loops)\n",
    "- Store and reuse (functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "In more recently, we explored simple variables as well as collection data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries. As programs get to be millions of lines long, it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand. We need ways to break large programs into multiple smaller pieces so that we have less to look at when solving a problem, `fix a bug`, or add a `new feature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, object oriented programming is a way to `arrange your code` so that you can zoom into 50 lines of the code and understand it while ignoring the other 999,950 lines.\n",
